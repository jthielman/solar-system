# Solar System

## Description
This app shows cards with the names of the planets in the solar system.  When the user moves the mouse over a card, the name is replaced by a picture of the planet.  Clicking on the picture brings up a larger card which includes both picture and name and adds a description of the planet underneath.  The user may click a red X in the upper right hand corner to return to the main view.
